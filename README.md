# TRACE Project - Labor Dynamics Institute

### Purpose

This repository was created to support the testing and debugging efforts for the TRACE project. TRACE (Transparency and Reproducibility in Economic and Social Sciences) is an 
initiative by the Labor Dynamics Institute (LDI) aimed at enhancing the reproducibility and transparency of research in the fields of economics and social sciences. The primary 
focus of this repository is to provide a robust environment where various testing and debugging scenarios can be executed efficiently.

### Objectives

1. **Testing**: Implement and run comprehensive test cases to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data processing scripts and analytical tools used in the TRACE project.
2. **Debugging**: Identify, analyze, and fix bugs in the codebase to improve the overall stability and functionality of the project.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of test cases, debugging procedures, and outcomes to facilitate knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.

### Contents

- **Scripts**: A collection of Python and R scripts designed to generate and log random test data, simulate various scenarios, and validate the integrity of the data processing pipeline.
- **Logs**: Log files generated during the testing and debugging processes, providing insights into the performance and behavior of the scripts.
- **Documentation**: Guides and documentation that outline the testing and debugging methodologies, along with detailed reports on the findings and resolutions.
